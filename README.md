Data visualization Project by Michael Nahum, Matteo Antonazzo and Emanuele Carosi

Summary 
For our project we decided to scrape data of european football transfermarket from the specialized site called Transfermakt. At first we thought to scrape data about last transfers, but at the end we decided to scrape multiple years in order to perform also time analysis, taking into consideration the pandemic effect. So, our dataset contains the top 625 transfers for player market value (assessed by transfermarkt) for years from 2018 to 2023. 
The project is structured in sections, starting from a general analysis of the market and arriving to analise specific players and clubs.
The sections can be summarised as follow:
- Dataset Scraping and Cleaning
- Dataset Description
- Exploratory Analysis and our story
- Covid Efect - Interactive Chart
- Premier League Interactions
- Interactive Graph Visualization - Cytoscape
